# PolkaGate (This is a work in progress, final version will be released soon, meantime please use [Polkadot js Plus](https://www.polkagate.xyz))

A user-friendly wallet to interact with the Polkadot/Substrate based blockchains through a browser. It allows users to access their Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem account(s), which can also be used to interact with decentralized apps.

## Installation 

### Add-on

The extension for firefox can be downloaded from [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkadot-js-plus-extension/)


### Development version

Steps to build the extension and view your changes in a browser:

1. Build via `yarn build` or `yarn watch`
2. Install the extension
  - Chrome:
    - go to `chrome://extensions/`
    - ensure you have the Development flag set
    - "Load unpacked" and point to `packages/extension/build`
    - if developing, after making changes - refresh the extension
  - Firefox:
    - go to `about:debugging#addons`
    - check "Enable add-on debugging"
    - click on "Load Temporary Add-on" and point to `packages/extension/build/manifest.json`
    - if developing, after making changes - reload the extension


Once added, you can create an account (via a generated seed) or import via an existing seed.


### Testing

* To run unit tests, first install dependencies using `yarn` then use: `yarn test:plus`

* Test on Westend blockchain:

   - It is possible via the provided [add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkadot-js-plus-extension/). To receive some westies (Westend's native token) for a created account use [Westend Faucet](https://matrix.to/#/#westend_faucet:matrix.org)

   - Or build the extension on your own, but it needs to append the following Westend network info to './node_modules/@substrate/ss58-registry/esm/index.js') before build:

     `{
		"prefix": 42,
		"network": "westend",
		"displayName": "Westend",
		"symbols": [
			"WND"
		],
		"decimals": [
			12
		],
		"standardAccount": "*25519",
		"website": "https://polkadot.network"
	}`
