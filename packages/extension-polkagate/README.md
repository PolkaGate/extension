A user-friendly wallet for seamless browser-based interaction with Polkadot/Substrate-based blockchains. It allows users to access their Polkadot account(s), which can also be used to interact with decentralized apps.

It is based on polkadot js extension, which injects a [@polkadot/api](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api) signer into a page, along with any associated accounts.
